## Installation

### Install via Composer (recommended):

```
$ composer require travelopia/wordpress-blade
```

This installs it as an MU Plugin. Load it and use it as needed!

### Manual Installation (if you know what you are doing):

1. Download this repository as a ZIP file.
2. Run `composer install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader`
3. Use it either as an MU plugin or a normal plugin!

## Building for Production

Compile your Blade components for production as a best practice. Some production environments are read-only, in which case this step is necessary.

Run the following command:

`php wp-content/mu-plugins/wordpress-blade/bin/compile.php --config-file=blade.config.php` - Ensure the path to the Blade config is correct.

## Usage

First, create a `blade.config.php` file at the root of your project, and add the following code in there:

```php
<?php
/**
 * Blade Config.
 *
 * @package wordpress-blade
 */

define(
	'WORDPRESS_BLADE',
	[
		'paths_to_views'         => [
			__DIR__ . '/wp-content/themes/<your-theme>/<path-to-your-components>',
			// Any other paths where Blade needs to look for components.
		],
		'path_to_compiled_views' => __DIR__ . '/wp-content/themes/<your-theme>/dist/blade', // Where you want Blade to save compiled files.
		'never_expire_cache'     => false, // Use `true` on production environments.
	]
);
```

### Bootstrap a layout.

As a best practice, and if applicable, bootstrap an entire layout like so:

```bladehtml
# bootstrap.blade.php
<x-layout>
    <x-hello name="Jane">Hi there!</x-hello>
</x-layout>
```

```bladehtml
# layout.blade.php
@php
    get_header();
@endphp

    <main>
        {{ $slot }}
    </main>

@php
    get_footer();
@endphp
```

```bladehtml
# hello.blade.php
@props( [
    'name' => '',
] )

<div>
    <h1>{{ $slot }}</h1>
    <p>Hello, {{ $name }}</p>
</div>
```

And then load the view in your template:

```php
Travelopia\Blade\load_view( 'bootstrap' );
```

You can also load an individual component like so:

```php
$name       = 'hello';              // The name of the component.
$attributes = [ 'name' => 'Jane' ]; // Properties / attributes to pass into the component.
$echo       = true;                 // Whether to echo the component. `false` returns the component as a string.

Travelopia\Blade\load_view( $name, $attributes, $echo );
```

This is especially useful when you want to load components from Blocks and Full Site Editing.
